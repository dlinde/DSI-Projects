## DSI Project Descriptions
This repo is home to three projects I completed as a student in General Assembly's Data Science Immersive program. 
* My first project explores Kaggle's Ames Housing Dataset, to which I applied principal component analysis and lasso regression to predict the sale prices of homes. 
* In my second project, I scraped job postings to attempt to a) classify whether a job posting is a data science job or a job in some related field and b) distinguish high-wage jobs from lower wage jobs. I also characterized what differentiates these jobs from each other, using both regression coefficients and term weights. 
* My most comprehensive project explores an anonymized dataset of Instacart customer orders, from which I derive features to fit a model that predicts which previously ordered items will be in customers' next orders. I then analyze the performance of the model and draw next steps for improving model performance.

## Jupyter 
I wrote these projects in Jupyter Notebooks. You can view any Notebook inside this repo by clicking on the project. To view or edit these Notebooks locally, you'll need to either: 
* Install [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#alternative-for-experienced-python-users-installing-jupyter-with-pip)
* Install and run [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
  * Start a container by running the command __docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 jupyter/scipy-notebook__
  * Visit the url the command generates to access the Notebook server
  * Upload a Notebook file
